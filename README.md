This is a mystery game web page that I created with a few of my peers. I worked on coding and debugging while my group members worked on the art, storyline, and debugging. 
This project is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
In order to run this code, download all of the files. The game starts in the "intro" file, within that file click on "index.html". In your code editor, right click and then press "open in default browser" or "open in other browsers." 
On the bottom right corner of the screen, you will have the option to  click on the "sound" or "mute" button depending on whether or not you want audio. 
Enjoy!
